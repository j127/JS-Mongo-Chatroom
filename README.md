This is an experiment with MongoDB. It's designed to be mostly client-side. The backend is Express because it's easy to deploy.

## Extras

Needs an .env file as mentioned here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18565512/important-of-session-secret-key-in-express-web-framework

The DB connection stuff is in /db which is not in version control.
